## Introduction to the Project-1 for Case Study on Craft Beers
## Context
It's a great time to be a craft beer fan in the U.S.! There are a ton of beer styles and brands to choose 
from and breweries have become very successful in the last several years. Breweries owe it all to beer lovers 
around the world! This dataset contains a list of 2,410 US craft beers and 510 US breweries. 
The beers and breweries are linked together by the "Brewery_id".

## DataSets
beers.csv - Contains dataset on 2000+ craft canned beers
breweries.csv - Contains dataset for 500+ breweries in the United States

## Approach for the project
The approach taken was to plot & then draw several inferences using the beers and breweries datasets.
The major product of the project work was centered across classifying the beers type into IPA's or Ale's using the IBU and ABV values of the beer.

## Here is where you can find all sorts of supporting material for this project under my GitHub repository:  
1. RMarkdown (RMD) file, which has all the code used in R language to draw data pre-processing, imputation, plots, model and drawing inferences.
2. Knit HTML file, which has plots and tables to supplement the RMD file in form of nice presentation of the project.
3. Codebook, which kind overview of the R code and serves purpose of a data dictionary.
4. ReadMe.md file, which has the summary of the work done for this project.
5. PPT (Powerpoint) presentation slides, which has all the plots and inferences drawn for the project and is presented to the CEO and CFO of the Budweiser (client) for this project.

## I had a blast working on this project, and thank you very much for visiting my GitHub repository to review and benefit from my project work.

## WAMO!!
