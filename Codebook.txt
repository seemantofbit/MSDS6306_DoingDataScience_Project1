## MSDS-6306-Doing-Data-Science-Fall-2019- Project-1
## Project member name: Seemant Srivastava
## Document Name: Codebook
## Document Purpose: To provide an overview of the variables used in the RMD file and serves the purpose of a data dictionary for the R code.

## Packages used
library(tidyr)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse) #package which reloads most of the tidy packages (ggplot2, dplyr, magrittr, lubridate, tidyr, etc.)
library(ggthemes)
library(plotly)
library(GGally)
library(caret)
library(class)
library(e1071) #package used for classification models k-NN and Naive Bayes
library(mice)  #package used for imputation
library(VIM)   #package used for plotting imputed values
library(ggmap)
library(maps)  #package used for getting united states maps information
library(mapdata)
library(sp)
library(maptools)
library(readr) 

## Dataframes used
beers # for capturing the Beers.csv file dataset 
brews # for capturing the Breweries.csv file dataset 
beersbrews # for capturing the merged dataset by combining beers and breweries datasets
beersbreweriesimputedmice # for capturing the imputed data during computation while using mice and VIM packages
beersbrewsimputed # for capturing the imputed data, which is the clean dataset and has all null values imputed, will be used in model
beersbreweriesimputedIPAAle # includes the IPAOrAle classifier feature added to the imputed dataset
beersbreweriesimputedIPAAleKNN # contains only the "IPA" or "Ale" beers in the dataset, used as input dataset for running the k-NN model & Naive Bayes model
d # contains the beersbrews (combined) dataset for drawing additional useful inference from the data for Budweiser

## Variables used
train # holds training dataset after doing cross validation
test # holds testing dataset after doing cross validation
classifications # holds the IPAOrAle classifications on the train dataset using k-NN model
CM # holds the confusionMatrix statistics after running the k-NN model
AccHolder # holds the accuracy for the Naive Bayes model
SensHolder # holds the sensitivity for the Naive Bayes model
SpecHolder # holds the specificity for the Naive Bayes model

## Note on Warning messages during the RMD execution
All Warnings produced during RMD execution were reviewed dillegently and were found to be soft warnings and don't impact any results, and can safetly be ignored.
